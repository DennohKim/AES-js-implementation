# AES-js-implementation

AES is an algorithm developed for the encryption of data using some standards.
It uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data, called symmetric encryption.

# Use cases
These algorithms are used in different communication apps such as WhatsApp, Signal, etc.
The flow is the message we write when sent is encrypted to pass through the internet so that no one can hack our message.

A practical example is given below using a third-party library, [JSAES](https://github.com/ricmoo/aes-js).
That only takes two arguments as a parameter,the first one for the text to encrypt and the second for the password.
